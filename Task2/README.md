# Task 2: Analyze a Phishing Email Sample.

## Step 1: Check the Sender Email Address
- Email: security@paypal-update.com
- Real PayPal uses: @paypal.com
- This domain (paypal-update.com) is fake.
- ✅This is a phishing sign.

## Step 2: Check for Suspicious Links
Hover over the link:
- Displayed: https://paypal-secure.com/verify
- But this is not a real PayPal website.
- Use this tool to check the link: https://www.virustotal.com/
- ✅Fake or suspicious URLs are a phishing sign.

## Step 3: Look at the Language
“Your account has been suspended… verify immediately.”
This uses urgent and threatening language to scare you.
✅ Another phishing sign.

## Step 4: Check Grammar and Spelling
“To avoid account termination…”
This message is okay grammatically, but phishing emails often have grammar mistakes. Always look carefully.

## Step 5: Analyze the Header (Optional)
If you had the full email header, you could use this tool:
👉 Google Header Analyzer
Paste in the header — it tells you if the email came from a strange IP.
✅ This helps detect forged emails.
